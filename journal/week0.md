# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## Required Homework/Tasks

    I started out with understanding of the Cruddur App Architecture to have an overview of what the App looks like. I proceeded to doing the following

### **Recreate Conceptual Diagram in Lucid Charts**

I designed the Conceptual Diagram on Lucid Charts, `see image` below

)

### **Recreate Logical Architectual Diagram in Lucid Charts**

I also worked on recreating the logical Diagram which includes the actual AWS Services to be used, `see image` below

    Next, I made sure in getting my cloud environment set up. The basic cloud environment setup I did is as follows:

### **Create an Admin User**

- I already have an `Admin User` created on my AWS account with `CLI privileges` called `CLI-Admin` (see image below).

- I also have `AWS CLI` installed (check this [article](https://medium.com/aws-in-plain-english/how-to-launch-an-ec2-instance-in-aws-15db3b22101d) for the installation process on ***Ubuntu***)

### Create a Budget and Billing Alarm

I created my own Budget for `$100` because I cannot afford any kind of spend.
I did not create a second Budget because I was concerned of budget spending going over the `2` budget free limit.

I also created an Alarm for the budget when it reaches a threshold of `80%`

### Added CLI-Admin Credentials to Gitpod Environment Variables
